# Plant Disease Classification Using CNN
<br><br>
The project involved the development of a website for detecting diseases in potato plants using deep learning techniques. The classification model was built using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and TensorFlow, and the dataset was augmented for improved accuracy. The website was developed using React JS and Fast API, allowing for seamless integration with the backend system. The TensorFlow dataset was used to efficiently manage the large amount of data required for the model training process. The resulting model achieved high accuracy in detecting potato plant diseases, making it a valuable tool for potato farmers and researchers.
